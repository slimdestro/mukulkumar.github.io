### Contact Profile

I am Mukul, a seasoned full-stack backend developer with over 10 years of experience specializing in Python and Golang for backend development. I have a strong background in building high-performance backends and cloud-native microservices (REST, gRPC, Socket, and Lambda) following CNCF standards.

My expertise extends to containerization, delivering fully containerized projects using Docker and various AWS resources. I am efficient in using distributed architecture for large systems utilizing Kafka and SQS, with exposure to building ETL processes in AWS and GCP.

On the frontend side, I have two years of experience with React and Svelte, complemented by proficiency in various JavaScript libraries, including jQuery, D3 charts, and numerous Node packages. I have taken on leadership roles, serving as a Team Lead where I oversaw end-to-end project development, managed Jira tasks, led scrum meetings, and handled resource management.
